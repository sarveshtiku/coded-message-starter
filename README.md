# 🔐 Decoder & Encoder Challenge

This project was built as part of CodePath's **SITE Summer Internship Lab: The Case of the Coded Message**. The goal was to build a JavaScript-based message decoder using string manipulation, Caesar ciphers, and DOM interaction — and to optionally extend it with additional features.

---

## ✅ Required Features

- **translateNumbers()**  
  Replaces specific characters:
  - `'3' → 'w'`
  - `'7' → 'l'`

- **reverseWords()**  
  Reverses the word order of a given message.

- **shiftCharacters()**  
  Decodes a Caesar cipher by shifting characters **backward by 3** with full wrap-around logic.

- **Decoder Interface**  
  Accepts user input and displays the decoded message dynamically using vanilla JavaScript and DOM methods.

---

## 🚀 Stretch Features

- **Encoder Tool**  
  A Caesar cipher encoder that allows the user to:
  - Enter any plain message
  - Choose a shift amount (1–25)
  - View the encoded output live on the page

- **Modular Functions**  
  Clean separation of logic for translation, word reversal, and shifting for better readability and reuse.

- *(Optional: Coming soon)* Dark mode toggle, copy-to-clipboard button, or downloadable `.txt` file.
